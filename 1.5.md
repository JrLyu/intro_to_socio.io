# The Case of Love: Culture, Social Structures, and Sentiment

We look at how social factors shape two aspects of romantic love in the US: Love and Marriage \& Sex without Love



## Who do you love?

1. Isn't it very individual and personal? 
   - All societies have ***distinct social patterns*** associated with love.
   - Our practices and beliefs about love are ***socially constructed***.

2. The Social Construction of Love: 

   - Eva Illouz's *Consuming the Romantic Utopia*

     - Helps illustrate the **social construction** of courtship/dating.

     - The changing space of courtship.

       1. Moved from the private sphere to the public sphere

       2. Dating involves negotiating public spaces; knowing how to conduct oneself: Manners, culturally constrained behaviors

          *e.g.: Country club, proper attire, adhering to the social norms of a particular group or subculture.* 

       3. The economization of social relationships: now \textbf{consumption} played a huge role in dating: How much money do we spend? Where do we spend it? 

   - Viviana Zelizer's *The Purchase of Intimacy*

     - Love is also a system that has its equivalence in goods, services, and entitlements. 

       ***Example***: How do you know when you are on a date? 

       	-  What was the meaning of the consumption we now saw in dating? 
       	-  What constitutes a gift and what constitutes payment? How do you know? 

   - We have cultural templates that allow us to understand: 

     - the intimacy level between two people

     - the behavioral boundaries of a relationship

     -  the economic boundaries of a relationship between two people 

   - These boundaries are regulated by institutions, emotions, time, and the law. 

3. Social Factors and Mate Selection: Choice of mate is linked to social structure

   - Patterns of mate selection: 

     - > ***Endogamy***: Endogamy refers to marriage within a social group	

     - > ***Exogamy***: Exogamy refers to marriage outside a social group	

     - > ***Social Stratification***: A group's system of ranking.
       > *Note: Society's ranking of different statuses (large groups of people) according to a hierarchy, often based on prestige/values.*

   - The US patterns: 
     - Social class: Most people marry within their own social class.
     - Education: People marry others with similar education.
     - Age: Usually, 2-3 years difference. Societies also define the right age to get married. 
     - Religion: Most marry within the same religious group, but less endogamous than other categories. 
     - Race: This is one of the most endogamous categories, but the proportion varies by race. 

   - Explanations for endogamous patterns:

     - Preferences play a role: 
       - Individuals have preference for certain characteristics in a spouse.
       - Our preferences are shaped by our social groups and statuses
     - Indirect regulation of mate selection
       - "Formally Free" mate selection, but **indirect regulation** through **restriction of social interaction**.
         - Influence of third parties (parents)
         - Propinquity (proximity: e.g., residential segregation; school; workplace)
         - Sanctions (e.g., religious)
       - Those indirect regulations are ways to assure you "marry the right person."

     - Regulation of mate selection ensures social control 
       - Without controls over mate selection - would have social chaos
       - Different interpretations of social control over love. 

     ***Example***: William Goode's *The Theoretical Importance of Love*

     - Free love threatens class system
     - Marriage between different class groups would disrupt social status of group
     - Mate selection is most important for those with power and property. So, they place more restrictions on children and their social interactions.
     - These mate selections patters serve to reinforce ad reproduce your **position in social structure**.

## What is Love? Definitions and meaning of Love

1. Love and Marriage: 

   ***Example***: Swidler: Talk of Love *(The link between love and marriage and how we use culture to socially construct those concepts)*

   - Background of book (Introduction): 
     - Interviewed 88 middle-class men and women from suburban areas San Jose, CA.
     - Not typical, but "Proto-typical" Americans
     - "Middle-class" culture tends to be the dominant culture in our country - or "mainstream" culture
     - Most of the participants were in their 30's and 40's and were or had been married. 

   - Culture nations of love: what is the cultural meaning of "romantic love" in the US? Two different views of love emerge in respondents' interviews. 

     - ***Love Myths - Mythic Love***
       - Historical origins: Courtly Love Tradition
       - Bourgeois tradition reshapes courtly love
         1.  A decisive choice (love at first sight)
         2. A unique other (one true love)
         3. Overcoming obstacles (marrying for love, not money)
         4.  Love lasts forever ("happily ever after")	
     - ***Real Love - Prosaic Realism***
       - Participants often de-bunk the notion of mythic love.
       - Offer an alternative cultural view of "real love": 
         - Love grows slowly; is often ambivalent and confused
         - One can love many people in a variety of ways
         - Love should be based on compatibility and practical traits that make good partners.
         - Love does not necessarily last forever. 
       - Love involves emotional sharing, communication, often equality, respect.
       - Working at the relationship day-to-day

     - People talk about both these views of love when talking about what love means to them

   2. Sex without Love: 

      - US in the 19th and 20th century: 

        Sex = Love (form Judeo-Christian culture)

        - Norm: Sex is part of committed loving relationship
        - Values: Sex is sacred part of love relationship between monogamous couple
        - So, sex without love is deviant
        - In 1950's, Kinsey survey showed that more people engaged in casual sex than was expected.
        - More recent patterns of sexual behavior\
        - Still, the US norm is against sex without loving commitment. 

      - 21st century

        ***Case Study***: Lambert et. al. *Pluralistic Ignorance and Hooking Up*

        - Background: 

          - In the post, research has assumed that sex without love is a problem (goes against norms). 

          - Today, on college campuses, this kind of behavior ("hooking up") has become normative.

          - > **Hooking up** occurs when two people who are casual acquaintances engage in some forms of sexual behavior with the expectation of no future commitment. 	

        - Background studies on "hooking up"
          - Prevalence: What is the prevalence of hooking up? 
          - Bad experiences: What "bad experiences" do students describe? Gender differences in bad experiences? 	

        - Theory: Pluralistic Ignorance: 
          - Perceptions of other's attitudes: Group members believe that **others** in their group (especially leaders or popular people) **endorse a particular norm**. 
          - Own attitudes: yet, they believe their **own personal attitudes** are different from the norm.
          - Actual behavior: however, they go along with the norm because: 
            - Desire to fit in with the group.
            - Each person thinks that they are **the only one who has conflict** between their **personal attitudes** and their **actual behavior**

        - Methods: 
          - Survey
          - Sample of 175 female and 152 male undergrads at mid-sized southeastern public university.
          - Convenience sample (library; residence halls)

        - Results: 
          - 77.7% of women said they had hooked up
          - 84.2% of men said they had hooked up
          - The results with regard to comfort level with hooking up? 
          -  Same-sex peers: How did men and women rate their comfort levels (self-ratings) as compared to others of same sex (peer-ratings)?
          - Opposite-sex peers: How did men and women rate the comfort levels of the opposite sex? Did they over- or under-estimate comfort levels? 
          - Gender differences: What were the overall gender differences? 

        - Conclusions: 
          - Findings support the theory of pluralistic ignorance:
            - Hooking up has become a norm on college campuses
            - Most students think other people are comfortable with it - more comfortable than they are themselves. 
          - \item Potential consequences of gender differences: 
            - Potential for sexual assault of women
            - Why?

        - Critiques of the study?
