# Basic Sociological Concepts - Culture

## Understanding Culture



1. > Culture: **Shared system of meaning**: what social structures/interactions mean. 
   >
   > - Shared system of meaning that exists in any society; undergirds social structure. 
   >
   > - The way we make distinctions between good and bad; important or not. 
   >
   > - Classifications; distinctions; values. 

2. Links between culture and social structure. 

   - Social structure are culture that are intertwined, but they focus on different aspects of a social life: 
     $$
     \text{(Social Structure)}\qquad\qquad\qquad\text{Statuses}\ \longrightarrow\ \text{(Roles)}\ \longrightarrow\ \text{Norms}
     $$

     $$
     \text{(Culture)}\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\text{prestige}\ \longleftrightarrow\ \text{Values}
     $$

3. > Values: Values often accompany **norms**: 
   >
   > - They justify norms and **provide believable reasons as to why we should conform**.
   >
   > - Values define what is worthwhile or important. 
   >
   > - They are shared believes of what is good or normal. 

4. > **Prestige**: Prestige often accompanies **status**. Based on values, prestige concerns **specific activities** or statuses that **the group defines as important and good**.

5. Different levels of Culture: 

   - Explicit: 
     - Culture operates in an explicit fashion.
     - Areas that explicitly/obviously deal with meaning.
     - Material culture
     - Values/Beliefs: 
       - Beliefs that people share regarding what is good, beautiful. 
       - Values define what is worthwhile, important. 

   - Implicit: 
     - It also operates in an implicit fashion. 
     - Parts of life that have meaning, but that we "take-or-granted"
     - Sometimes, we hold values and beliefs that are implicit: we do NOT recognize them as values/cultures. 

## Culture shock and Ethnocentrism

1. > **Ethnocentrism**: Tendency to regard our way of life as the **right** way. 

2. Cultural relativity: 

   - Stance taken by social scientists (opposite of ethnocentrism)
   - Different societies create different values and different systems of meaning. 
   - Difference does not equal "right" or "wrong"

3. > **Culture Shock**: A feeling of confusion, doubt, or nervousness (or disorientation) caused by being in a place (such as a foreign country) that is different from what people are used to.

## Social Construction of Reality

1. Our world is "socially constructed":

   - "Construction" aspect: 
     - Nothing contains meaning in-and-of-itself
     - Humans "construct" or create meaning; including categories/distinctions that are important (e.g. gender/race)

   - "Social" aspect:
     - Humans create meaning together. 
     - Meaning is created through social interaction/social processes.
     - People decide together on meanings to assign categories/distinctions, events, objects. 

   ***Example***: How to Become a Batman Podcast

   - How is blindness a "social construction"?
     - Our expectations of blind people from one another (The social world)
     - What does the meaning of blindness? Can blind people "see"? Or does a blind people need help from non-blind people?
     - The meaning we give to "blindness" effects both the blind and the non-blind. It impacts our interactions. 
     - In fact, the non-blind constrain the behaviors of the blind as a consequence. 
     - We change our expectations of human beings because of meanings we "take-for-granted".
     - Meaning - what something means - can change our behavior.  

   - Questions to think about: 
     - Where did your thoughts/beliefs about blind people come from?
     - How do you, personally, respond when you see someone who might be blind?  Why do you respond the way you do?
     - Daniel and Adam got “lumped together” in their school.  People would mix them up, thinking one was the other.  
     - Has this ever happened to you?  Why were you “lumped together” with someone else? How did you respond?  Why do you think you responded the way you did?
     - Do you live in a world that believes you can’t do certain things? (Think of the man who worked in a paint factory)
     - What would happen if we changed our expectations of what blind people can do?  Do you think we should?
     - Have you ever been the subject of someone else’s lower expectations of you?  How did you respond?

   ***Example***: The 7 Day Week

   - Reality of the 7-Day Week: 
     - The week is ubiquitous, but taken-for-granted -> Implicit culture
     - The week gives us a "temporal map" to organize our lives

   - The week is a social construction of reality: 
     - It does not correspond to any naturally occurring phenomenon.
     - It is made by people, together (part of culture): 
       1. Origins of the 7-day week: 
          - Judaism
          - Astrology	
       2. Attempts to change the 7-day week: Soviet Union. These attempts did not work: Because culture was so embedded in people's lives that it seemed "inevitable."

2. Social Construction of Reality
   - Our world is "socially constructed."
   - People create meaning together. 
   - Because meaning are created by people, ***People can change them***. (This usually only happens in extraordinary circumstances.)

3. Meaning, Behavior, and Norms

   - New meanings (new social construction of reality) will produce new behaviors.
   - All groups must have norms or rules that govern these new behaviors.
   - Without norms or rules (without structure), people do not know how to relate to each other, and we have chaos. 

   ***Example***: Henslin, Survivors of F-227 - How is the "social construction of reality" illustrated with the crash survivors in the Andes?

   - Social Construction of Reality

     - What ***deeply held cultural meaning***is at the heart of this situation? 

     - How do their normal circumstances change - ***what is their new social context***?

       Why does this new social context challenge their deeply held values? 

     - How does *cultural meaning change because of new social context*?

   - Meaning, Behavior, and Norms: 
     - After meaning changes, *how does group behavior change*?
     - *How do norms develop* to guide this new behavior? 
     - What norms did the group put into place?
