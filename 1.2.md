# How Do We Do Sociology? (Sociological Research Methods)

## Sociology Research Model

1.  Theory V.S. Research: 

   - Theory - Definition: 

     1. A systematic **explanation** for the observed facts that relate to a particular aspect of life. 

     2. General propositions about the relationship between two or more concepts (variable).
        $$
        A\  \xrightarrow[]{\text{ impact }}\ B
        $$

   - Empirical research: 

     1. Definition: 

        > Using ***systematically gathered data*** to prove a theory.

     2. Sociologists conduct research - gather data about real people - to determine if theories are true depictions and predictions of reality. 

   - Method: 

     > The way we gather data for empirical research.
     >
     > ***Note***: Your theory and your method must connect to each other. 

2. The Sociology Research Model: 

   - Develop a ***Research Question***: Select topic \& Define problem: 

     > **Research Question (RQ)**:
     > The relationship between two or more concepts or variables. (How does A affect B? )

   - ***Theory***: Review theoretical literature: 

     1. What theories have been used to address this research question in the past?
     2. Choose specific theory (or theories) you want to test.

   - ***Hypothesis***: 

     > A hypothesis is a statement of what you expect to find based on the theory. A hypothesis predicts a relationship between two or more concepts. 

   - ***Empirical test***: The heart of a sociological research

     1. Choose a Method (*will be discussed later*)
     2. Collect the data		

   - ***Results***: What did I find? 

     1. Analyze results
     2. Present your findings - summarizing key points, and illustrating the results with:
        - How do my findings tie into my hypotheses?
        - How do my findings fit with previous research?
        - What might be desirable further research?



## Different Social Research Method

### Survey Research

1. Survey - Definition

   > In survey research, sociologists collect data through asking people questions. They set questions, followed by a list of responses, in a survey. Most data from surveys are \textbf{quantitative} (numeric).
   >
   > ***Example***: a Likert Scale
   >
   > â€‹	"One a scale of 1 to 5, ..."

2. Importance things to consider when setting or conducting a survey research: 

   - Types of survey: 

     1. Self-administered questionnaires (such as via email)
     2. Phone surveys
     3. In-person surveys (such as an interview)

   - Population: 

     1. Define the group you want to study
     2. Often dependent on your research questions and past literatures.

   - Sampling: 

     1. How sample chosen is extremely important for results

     2. Sample should \textbf{represent} the entire Population

     3. Probability sampling: 

        > In simplest form, each person in the population has an equal chance of being chosen for the study. 	

   - Question wording: 
     1. Form, wording, and context of questions are important for accurate results.
     2.  Complex issues need multiple questions. 

3. Advantages and Disadvantages of Survey Research: 
   - Pros: 
     1. Best way of learning about large populations.
     2. Data can be representative of the large population (with good sampling and response rate)
     3. Standardization of data
     4. Economy - cost
     5. Time
   - Cons: 
     1. Poorly worded questions yield poor data.
     2. Questions can be somewhat artificial (or superficial).
     3. Data can be potentially superficial.
     4. Difficult to gain a full sense of social processes in their natural settings. 

### Qualitative Research (Field Research)

1. Definition: 

   - Qualitative Research

     > Systematic, often long-term (around 1 to 10 years), observation of social phenomena in natural settings.

   - Most often, we use qualitative research for ***topics that are complex*** and not easy to assess using surveys. 

2. Data are qualitative - **Non-numerical**

   - Data collected in text form (not numerical scales)
   - The text from notes and interviews are **coded** and organized around themes.
   - Then they are systematically analyzed for patterns
   - Summaries are usually non-numerical (although one may count how many people mentioned particular themes).

3. Observation as a type of Qualitative Research: 

   - Definition: 

     > Observe a group of people or a certain event.

   - Data are collected through: 

     - Field journal
     - Interviews

     Different Types of Questions Asked: Interviews use open-ended questions, whereas surveys ask close-ended questions.

   - Types of Observation: 

     1. Direct observation: 
        - Researcher observes a social group as an **outsider**.
        - Does not become part of the group in any way.
        - Usually no influence on group dynamics.

     2. Participant Observation: 
        - Researcher goes beyond mere observation to participate in the group they are studying.
        - Potential for influencing the group.

4. In-Depth Interviews as a type of Qualitative Research: 
   - Usually a part of observation studies.
   - Can also be done as a separate method.
   - Explore a topic at a more complex level. 
   - Use when you want **depth** and **diversity** of views. 
   - Interviewer has very general questions and has the respondent talk at length. 
   - Potential for interviewer bias. 
5. Advantages of Qualitative Research: 
   - Able to study nuances of attitudes and behaviors.
   - Able to study whole group - defining social structure of group.
   - More **depth** and better understanding of what is studied.
   - Can be inexpensive. 
6. Disadvantages of Qualitative Research: 
   - Time-intensive
   - Potential for subjectivity and bias.
   - Conclusions are regarded as **suggestive** rather than **definitive**.
   - Smaller sample - *less generalizability* to larger populations.

### Experiment

1. This is the most rigorous controllable of the methods. 

2. You define a situation you want to test and then create that situation in a lab. 

3. Groups in Experiments: 

   > **Experimental group**: exposed to test factor.
   >
   > **Control group**: identical in terms of types of individuals, but not exposed to test factor. 

5. Advantages of Experiments: 
   - Control over variables. 
   - Can test specific influences over a specific situation.

6. Disadvantages of Experiments: 
   - Artificial environment: how do you know lab settings will be the same as in real life? 
   - Limited in scope
   - Ethical concerns - Moral concerns of human subject experiments *(This has been addressed, by and large, through Institutional Review Boards (IRBs))*

***Example***: Milgram's Experiment

- Introduction: 
  1. Psychological experiment in early 1960s. 
  2. Conducted variations with different groups/samples. 
  3. Slightly different from most experiments today - no control group. 
- Purpose: 
  1. Involved observing people's willingness to harm others when following orders. 
  2. Wanted to see threshold for when people would take personal responsibility and disobey superior. 
- Why do people obey authority figures? 
  1. Assume their authority figures. 
  2. Fear reprimand/anticipate reward.
  3. Pass responsibility on to someone else ("just following orders")
  4. etc. (look at social context for answers...)

- Effect on participants: 
  - Through a later survey, 83% said they were glad they had participated. 
  - Yet, many personally experienced problems during the experiment. 
  - Some felt shame; others justified their behavior. 

- Critiques of method: 
  - Its psychological effects on the participants. 
  - Deception of the participants. 

## Ethics in Research
1. These studies like Milgram's experiment has led to: 
   - Codes of ethics to protect human subjects
   - Institutional Review Boards (IRRs)
2. A note on peer review	

## Causation vs. Correlation

1. Definitions: 

   - > ***Correlation***: A relationship between two variables.

   - > ***Causation***: One variable causes another. 

2. Element of time - which came first

3. Intervening - or third - variable

***Case Study***: *Bad Feminist* by Roxane Gay

- Why read this article (as it is not sociological research)? 
  - Gay emphasizes the importance of cultural awareness and developing cross-cultural knowledge and skills. 
  - She wants us to pay attention - critically and carefully - to the world around us. 
  - She also articulates the importance of grace - wherein people are allowed to make mistakes, learn, and evolve. 
  - It is an educational approach to life. 
  - It is not an approach wherein we imagine we know everything already and attack other who "don't get it."
  - To a certain degree, she is also exploring "imperfection."
- What is this essay about? 
  -  Gay confronts the reductive nature of feminism and the stereotypes it produces. 
  - She also addresses her own reservations towards embracing feminism itself. 
  - One thing not in the essay (but she does take up elsewhere) is that *feminism is also a social movement*. 
- Exercise: 
  - She points to Judith Butler to articulate the ways in which we all "perform" our gender. 
  - Judith Butler: American Philosopher and gender theorist.
  - Is there a "right" way to be a woman? Or a "right" way to be a man? 
- What is sociological about feminism? 
  - Sociology often explores the unequal distribution of power and resources, feminist sociology studies power in its relation to gender. 
  - Feminist scholars study a range of topics, including sexual orientation, race, economic status, and nationality. 
  - At the core of feminist sociology is the idea that, in most societies, women have been systematically oppressed and that **men have been historically dominant**. (This is referred to as **patriarchy**.)
  - All of these categories - including 'feminist' - are being controlled by stereotypes and judgments. 
- Gay on Categories: 
  - "We are categorized and labeled from the moment we come into this world by gender, race, size, hair color, eye color, and so forth."
  - "Again, we see this fear of categorization, this fear of being forced into a box that cannot quite accommodate a woman properly." [and, a man ... and other gender categories ...]
- ***Gay's critique of many white feminists***
  - Not interested in the issues unique to women of color - having to work against a different set of stereotypes ("angry black woman', etc.); are oftentimes dismissive. 
  - Worried that a recognition of differences among feminists will lead to divisiveness.
  - Their argument that black women need to do the work of making feminist organizations more inclusive.
  - Appropriation of material (ideas, etc.)
  - Gay notes that there are problems with feminism - it is not perfect: There are problems with all social movements, and as they expand, they are often characterized by divisiveness.
