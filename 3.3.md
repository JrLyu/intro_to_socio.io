# Organizations

## Types of Social Order

1. These three "types" are different ways of **organizing society to maintain order**.

    - Each provides beliefs about: 
        - Why some people should exercise authority.
        - And why other people should obey.
    
    - Traditional: 
        - Social order based on a belief in **custom**.
        - Social action is based on **respect for traditional ways**.
    
    - Charismatic: 
        - Social order based on a belief in an **extraordinary leader**.
        - Social action is based on **commitment to a cause** or mission.
    
    - Rational (Legal-rational): 
        - Social order based on **impersonal rules** or laws.
        - Social action involves tasks carried out in **conformity to rules** and regulations. 

2. **These three types of social order may also be applied to different types of organizations.**

## Formal Organizations

1. > ***Formal Organizations**: Groups with a purpose (and means) to achieve certain ends.

    - Ends: "product" or goals
    
    - Means: "organizational practices"
        - Ways of controlling workers to produce ends.
        - Ways to motivate workers to obey and accept organizational routines and purposes.

2. Different *organizational types* (traditional, rational, charismatic) have different **organizational practices**.

3. We will be looking at two types of organizations: 
    
    - **Rational Organizations**: Bureaucracy

    - **Charismatic Organizations**: Direct Selling Organizations

## *Rational* Organization: Bureaucracy

1. Dominant form of organizations in the modern U.S.: "Rational Social ORder"

2. > ***Bureaucracy***: **Organization** designed to increase **efficiency** through **rational** means.

    - Ends: product produced *efficiently*

    - Means: *rational*, objective

    - Accomplish large-scale tasks by coordinating the work of many individuals.

    - Whole system functions for optimum *efficiency* by *controlling* large numbers of people. 

3. Weber and the "Ideal Type" Bureaucracy: 
    
    - "Ideal Type" of Bureaucracy: 
        - Take all possible characteristics of bureaucracies
        - Describe them as if all present at same time in same place
        - "Model" to study real bureaucracies
        - 4 major elements/Organizational Practices (Weber had others): 
            - Rules and Regulations
            - Specialization of Tasks (Differentiation)
            - Hierarchy (Stratification)
            - Impersonality
        
    - **Rules and Regulations**: "Bureaucracy" = "the rule of officials"
        - Rules are at the center of bureaucracy
        - Bureaucracies must operate in a completely **predictable** way. 
        - Rules **standardize** the work
        - Rules usually apply to the **job tasks**
            - Everyone in same job does same tasks in the same way.
            - Routines are another aspect of this.
        - Allow workers to know how to do job
        - **Routine, standard** ways of doing things
        - Rules ensure that anyone who enters the job will be able to fulfill the tasks. *E.g., Secretary with innovative filing system?*
        - Sometimes rules can be intrusive. *E.g., Dress codes - high school*
        - Rules also aid in creating an organizational identity.
    
    - **Specialization of Tasks - Division of Labor**: 
        - Divide up the tasks of the organization
        - Certain people specialize in these smaller tasks
        - Efficient way to handle complex work
            - *E.g., Auto manufacturing and assembly line*
            - *E.g., University - specialized office*
    
    - **Hierarchy** (and career ladders)
        - Arrange personnel in a vertical ranking of offices
        - Division between upper and lower offices
        - Part of structure is orderly move up the hierarchy.
        - Career ladders - for certain people
        - Allows coordination of many activities and employees
            - *E.g., Investment Banking Corporation: CEO, Vice-Presidents, Executive Directors, Managing Directors, Associates, Financial Analysts*
    
    - **Impersonal relationships**: For bureaucracies to be efficient, must be absent of emotional or personal bonds
        - Separate emotional ties from job: 
            - Loyalty is to organization, not to particular people
            - Functioning of organization not dependent on personal ties.
        - Universal Standards
            - Impartial standards for all employees. *E.g., Professor treats all students the same.*
            - Also, same treatment for all customers
            - Ensures all are treated uniformly
            - Eliminates all personal and irrational elements.
            - If this is not done, you get corruption, nepotism
        - Compensation: Fixed payment structure
            - Important to have fixed salary attached to each job or position.
            - Helps retain impersonality and universal standards. 

4. Problems of Bureaucracy: 

    - **Dehumanization**: 
        - Impersonality leads to dehumanization
        - Reduces workers to "a small cog in a ceaselessly moving mechanism"
        - Impersonality leads to not considering clients' unique, personal needs. 
    
    - **Inefficienty**: 
        - > ***Inefficientcy***: the failure of an organization to carry out the work that it exists to perform.
        - > ***Ritualism***: preoccupation with rules to the point of thwarting an organization's goals: 
            - Concentration on rules replaces concern for goals
            - Follow rules, for rules' sake, not for true purpose. 
            - *E.g., US Postal Service after 9/11*

5. ***Modern Example***: Robin Leidner, "*Over the Counter at McDonal's*"

    - Excerpt from her book: *Fast Food, Fast Talk: Service Work and the Routinization of Everyday Life (1993)*
        - Participant observation at McDonalds over quite a period of time.
        - Her *focus is on the workers* - and the impact of bureaucracy on workers. 
    
    - **A Rational Organization**: 
        - Founder of MacDonald's (Kroc) designed the whole process for **efficiency** and **uniformity of the product (standardization)**. 
        - It illustrates Weber's four major elements of bureaucracy. 
    
    - Rules and routines: 
        - This is the heart of the article.
        - Rules and regulations account for precise preparation, same in every store. *Examples?*
        - This ensures: UNIFORMITY and EFFICIENCY
        - Uniformity: 
            - Precise calculations to produce **uniform, standardized** product
            - Emphasis on the quantitative aspects of products - size, cost, and time. *Examples?*
        - Efficiency: 
            - Every bit of food and drink is closely monitored by computer (no waste or excess). *Examples?*
            - Even the customer knows the rules. *Why is this important for efficiency?*
    
    - Specialization of Tasks: 
        - Making and serving the product is broken down into small pieces.
        - Small, specialized tasks both by workers and machines.
        - Highly bureaucratic system that leaves nothing to chance. *Examples?*
    
    - Hierarchy: 
        - "Hamburger University" - very specific chain of command, training, and hierarchy. 
        - How does this play out in the restaurants?

    - Impersonality: 
        - The most unreliable element in McDonald's system is human beings. 
        - Behavior of workers - and customers - is reduced to a series of machine-like actions
            - Although a certain "friendliness" is scripted - this is uniform, not truly personal.
        - To minimized unpredictable human element, automated systems are developed. 
            - *How does automation enforce "impersonality"?*
            - Examples?*
    
    - This bureaucratic structure is very good at producing a standardized, uniform product, efficiently.
        - But what else do these organizational practices produce for the **workers**? 
        - *Examples?*
    
    - Dehumanization - as Weber feared...
        - “The ultimate irrationality” of a rational system “is that people could lose control over the system and it would come to control us.” (Ritzer)
        - People lose their creativity
        - And lose capacity for correcting error, or for surprise and imagination

## *Charismatic* Organizations

1. Differences from Bureaucracy: 

| Bureaucratic | Charismatic |
| :----------: | :---------: |
| Economic rationality (Weber) is the ideological basis that undergirds the majority of organizations (bureaucracies) today | While economic rationality dominates life today, value-rational organizations are also common (organizations that are built on moral or value rationality) |
| Economic rationality is associated with a systematic orientation to profit and efficiency | Many often have charismatic leaders |
| Economic rationality is clearly not evident in DSOs (Direct Selling Organizations) | |

2. What is charisma: 

    - Charisma, according to Weber, has four elements:
        - "Charisma is a 'gift of grace' or rare quality that resides in an individual; 
        - the proof of charisma is the presence of followers;
        - charisma demands that followers develop new selves and repudiate their former way of life; and
        - charismatic leaders must demonstrate their abilities "through miracles, the continued success of a mission, or other proofs."
    
    - *E.g., heroes, oracles: Interactions are "based on an emotional form of communal relationship*

    - [60 minutes spot (3:30 mins)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrWz_MzKAMk)

3. Charismatic Control: Three basic means by which social order and commitment are maintained: 
    
    - Creation of a new self: individual's development of a new social identity around the organization's mission

    - Celebration of group membership: members' acceptance of the community of believers

    - Becoming a stakeholder in the organization: practices designed to promote organizational continuity.

4. ***Example***: DSO's : *Nicole Woolsey Biggart, Charismatic Capitalism*

    - Mary Kay Cosmetics - Direct Sell Cosmetics Company
        - Cosmetics that cannot be bought in stores.
        - Weaker form of charismatic organization (Mary Kay Ash Leader): Sale's group leaders
        - DSO workers are legally independent: 
            - Every distributor is an "entrepreneur"
            - So... how to control worker? 
    
    - Methods: 
        - 95 interviews with distributors, DSO managers, and trade association executives; 
        - Extensive fieldwork (sat in on a lot of DSO sales meetings and regional and national conventions); and
        - Statistical data on the industry. 
    
    - Social Control at Mary Kay: 
        - Creation of a New Self: 
            - Self-transformation: encouraged to think one's way to success, must embrace positive thinking
            - Confessionals: I was a broken woman, and now I'm a millionaire.
            - Differentiation: more successful distributors are given gifts and prestigious titles and set apart at meetings.
            - Leadership: Mary Kay Ash, other leaders serve as examples of how to live. 
            - ***Example***: [Modern day version – announcement of new national sales director](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqhkUdSuSE)
        - Celebration of Group Membership: 
            - "Get everything you need in life here" - take care of all of the members' social needs within the group: 
                - "how to do a breast exam" videos at conferences
                - distributors often socialize only with other distributors and their families. 
            - Compartmentalization: distributors relationships are often channeled so that distributors only see others in their "line," regardless of geography.
            - Homogeneity: People associate with others like themselves: 
                - In DSOs, distributors are urged to recruit friends and family.
            - Common Efforts: team awards like the pink Cadillacs.
            - Regularized Group Contact: at least weekly meetings
                - [Mary Kay Leadership Meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1xM-bZoGtY)
        - Stakeholder claims: 
            - Sacrifice: Sacrifice for other distributors (Miss Go-Give Award)
            - Investment: if you leave the DSO, you lose all future financial rewards from downline members. Also, there are very severe social costs associated with leaving. 

5. Why does it work? 

    - **Status is achieved** by embodying the organization's ideals
        - Being an "entrepreneur" is understood to be a morally superior way of being in the economy.
    
    - Workers and distributors often love feeling that they are **part of an important moral enterprise**, not just a profit-making business.
        - This association helps them create a "better" self, someone identified with an elevated purpose
    
    - The **charismatic leader** is as an exemplar. 
        - They started off as "ordinary" people who achieved great success by following an entrepreneurial ideology.
