<h3 id="survey-research">Survey Research</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Survey - Definition</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In survey research, sociologists collect data through asking people questions. They set questions, followed by a list of responses, in a survey. Most data from surveys are \textbf{quantitative} (numeric).</p>
<p><strong><em>Example</em></strong>: a Likert Scale</p>
<p>&#x200B;    &quot;One a scale of 1 to 5, ...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Importance things to consider when setting or conducting a survey research: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Types of survey: </p>
<ol>
<li>Self-administered questionnaires (such as via email)</li>
<li>Phone surveys</li>
<li>In-person surveys (such as an interview)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Population: </p>
<ol>
<li>Define the group you want to study</li>
<li>Often dependent on your research questions and past literatures.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Sampling: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>How sample chosen is extremely important for results</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sample should \textbf{represent} the entire Population</p>
</li>
<li><p>Probability sampling: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In simplest form, each person in the population has an equal chance of being chosen for the study.     </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Question wording: </p>
<ol>
<li>Form, wording, and context of questions are important for accurate results.</li>
<li>Complex issues need multiple questions. </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Advantages and Disadvantages of Survey Research: </p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: <ol>
<li>Best way of learning about large populations.</li>
<li>Data can be representative of the large population (with good sampling and response rate)</li>
<li>Standardization of data</li>
<li>Economy - cost</li>
<li>Time</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Cons: <ol>
<li>Poorly worded questions yield poor data.</li>
<li>Questions can be somewhat artificial (or superficial).</li>
<li>Data can be potentially superficial.</li>
<li>Difficult to gain a full sense of social processes in their natural settings. </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="qualitative-research-field-research">Qualitative Research (Field Research)</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Definition: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Qualitative Research</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Systematic, often long-term (around 1 to 10 years), observation of social phenomena in natural settings.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Most often, we use qualitative research for <strong><em>topics that are complex</em></strong> and not easy to assess using surveys. </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Data are qualitative - <strong>Non-numerical</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Data collected in text form (not numerical scales)</li>
<li>The text from notes and interviews are <strong>coded</strong> and organized around themes.</li>
<li>Then they are systematically analyzed for patterns</li>
<li>Summaries are usually non-numerical (although one may count how many people mentioned particular themes).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Observation as a type of Qualitative Research: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Observe a group of people or a certain event.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Data are collected through: </p>
<ul>
<li>Field journal</li>
<li>Interviews</li>
</ul>
<p>Different Types of Questions Asked: Interviews use open-ended questions, whereas surveys ask close-ended questions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Types of Observation: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Direct observation: </p>
<ul>
<li>Researcher observes a social group as an <strong>outsider</strong>.</li>
<li>Does not become part of the group in any way.</li>
<li>Usually no influence on group dynamics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Participant Observation: </p>
<ul>
<li>Researcher goes beyond mere observation to participate in the group they are studying.</li>
<li>Potential for influencing the group.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>In-Depth Interviews as a type of Qualitative Research: </p>
<ul>
<li>Usually a part of observation studies.</li>
<li>Can also be done as a separate method.</li>
<li>Explore a topic at a more complex level. </li>
<li>Use when you want <strong>depth</strong> and <strong>diversity</strong> of views. </li>
<li>Interviewer has very general questions and has the respondent talk at length. </li>
<li>Potential for interviewer bias. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Advantages of Qualitative Research: <ul>
<li>Able to study nuances of attitudes and behaviors.</li>
<li>Able to study whole group - defining social structure of group.</li>
<li>More <strong>depth</strong> and better understanding of what is studied.</li>
<li>Can be inexpensive. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Disadvantages of Qualitative Research: <ul>
<li>Time-intensive</li>
<li>Potential for subjectivity and bias.</li>
<li>Conclusions are regarded as <strong>suggestive</strong> rather than <strong>definitive</strong>.</li>
<li>Smaller sample - <em>less generalizability</em> to larger populations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="experiment">Experiment</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>This is the most rigorous controllable of the methods. </p>
</li>
<li><p>You define a situation you want to test and then create that situation in a lab. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Groups in Experiments: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Experimental group</strong>: exposed to test factor.</p>
<p><strong>Control group</strong>: identical in terms of types of individuals, but not exposed to test factor. </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Advantages of Experiments: </p>
<ul>
<li>Control over variables. </li>
<li>Can test specific influences over a specific situation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages of Experiments: </p>
<ul>
<li>Artificial environment: how do you know lab settings will be the same as in real life? </li>
<li>Limited in scope</li>
<li>Ethical concerns - Moral concerns of human subject experiments <em>(This has been addressed, by and large, through Institutional Review Boards (IRBs))</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>Example</em></strong>: Milgram&apos;s Experiment</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction: <ol>
<li>Psychological experiment in early 1960s. </li>
<li>Conducted variations with different groups/samples. </li>
<li>Slightly different from most experiments today - no control group. </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Purpose: <ol>
<li>Involved observing people&apos;s willingness to harm others when following orders. </li>
<li>Wanted to see threshold for when people would take personal responsibility and disobey superior. </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Why do people obey authority figures? </p>
<ol>
<li>Assume their authority figures. </li>
<li>Fear reprimand/anticipate reward.</li>
<li>Pass responsibility on to someone else (&quot;just following orders&quot;)</li>
<li>etc. (look at social context for answers...)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Effect on participants: </p>
<ul>
<li>Through a later survey, 83% said they were glad they had participated. </li>
<li>Yet, many personally experienced problems during the experiment. </li>
<li>Some felt shame; others justified their behavior. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Critiques of method: </p>
<ul>

<p><strong><em>Case Study</em></strong>: <em>Bad Feminist</em> by Roxane Gay</p>
<ul>
<li>Why read this article (as it is not sociological research)? <ul>
<li>Gay emphasizes the importance of cultural awareness and developing cross-cultural knowledge and skills. </li>
<li>She wants us to pay attention - critically and carefully - to the world around us. </li>
<li>She also articulates the importance of grace - wherein people are allowed to make mistakes, learn, and evolve. </li>
<li>It is an educational approach to life. </li>
<li>It is not an approach wherein we imagine we know everything already and attack other who &quot;don&apos;t get it.&quot;</li>
<li>To a certain degree, she is also exploring &quot;imperfection.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is this essay about? <ul>
<li>Gay confronts the reductive nature of feminism and the stereotypes it produces. </li>
<li>She also addresses her own reservations towards embracing feminism itself. </li>
<li>One thing not in the essay (but she does take up elsewhere) is that <em>feminism is also a social movement</em>. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exercise: <ul>
<li>She points to Judith Butler to articulate the ways in which we all &quot;perform&quot; our gender. </li>
<li>Judith Butler: American Philosopher and gender theorist.</li>
<li>Is there a &quot;right&quot; way to be a woman? Or a &quot;right&quot; way to be a man? </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is sociological about feminism? <ul>
<li>Sociology often explores the unequal distribution of power and resources, feminist sociology studies power in its relation to gender. </li>
<li>Feminist scholars study a range of topics, including sexual orientation, race, economic status, and nationality. </li>
<li>At the core of feminist sociology is the idea that, in most societies, women have been systematically oppressed and that <strong>men have been historically dominant</strong>. (This is referred to as <strong>patriarchy</strong>.)</li>
<li>All of these categories - including &apos;feminist&apos; - are being controlled by stereotypes and judgments. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gay on Categories: <ul>
<li>&quot;We are categorized and labeled from the moment we come into this world by gender, race, size, hair color, eye color, and so forth.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Again, we see this fear of categorization, this fear of being forced into a box that cannot quite accommodate a woman properly.&quot; [and, a man ... and other gender categories ...]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>Gay&apos;s critique of many white feminists</em></strong><ul>
<li>Not interested in the issues unique to women of color - having to work against a different set of stereotypes (&quot;angry black woman&apos;, etc.); are oftentimes dismissive. </li>
<li>Worried that a recognition of differences among feminists will lead to divisiveness.</li>
<li>Their argument that black women need to do the work of making feminist organizations more inclusive.</li>
<li>Appropriation of material (ideas, etc.)</li>
<li>Gay notes that there are problems with feminism - it is not perfect: There are problems with all social movements, and as they expand, they are often characterized by divisiveness. </li>
</ul>
</li>
