## Gender Segregation in the Workplace

1. Definitions: 

    - > ***Gender/Sex Segregation in the Workplace***: the concentration of men and women in different occupations, jobs, and places of work. 

    - > ***Occupation-level segregation***: whole occupations are either predominantly male or female. 
        - Men and women are doing different tasks here. 
            - *E.g., Nurses are mostly women; mechanics are mostly men.*
            - *E.g., Managers are mostly men, and secretaries mostly women.*
    
    - > ***Job-level segregation: within the same occupation, there is sex segregation in the specific jobs.
        - *E.g., Salespeople at Sears - men sell appliances, women sell clothing.*
        - *E.g., Female bank tellers are in suburban branch; mostly male tellers at downtown branch.*

2. Contemporary Patterns: Gender Segregation 

    - [Persistent Occupational Segregation](http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm)

    - Job segregation within integrated occupations: We still have job segregation within occupations
        - Physicians: Women tend to go into: 
            - ob/gyn (76% residents are female, 2015)
            - pediatrics (70% residents are female, 2015)
            - psychiatry (53% residents female, 2015)		
            - family medicine (52% residents female, 2015)
        - Men dominate:
            - neurosurgery, cardiology, oncology (80-90% men) 
            - general surgery (72% residents are male, 2015)		
        - Real Estate
            - Female real estate agents are concentrated in residential sales, 
            - Men continued to dominate commercial sales.
    
    - What is associated with these different jobs?

3. Consequences of Gender Segregation: 

    - Separating groups into different places and different roles **makes it easier to treat them unequally**

    - Nature of jobs/occupations is tied to **income** as well as **authority and promotion**. 

    - [***Example***](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/business/women-pay-gap/?utm_term=.f7f88628326c)

    - Wage gap: 
        - Sex segregation in jobs is *one factor* that influences differences in **earnings**. 
    
    - Sex differences in promotion and authority: *Padavic & Reskin reading*: 
        - Heavily female occupations are often **dead-end** (no higher position to go to) *E.g., Child-care worker*
        - Women concentrated at **low levels or less prestigious roles**; with less opportunity for advancement. *E.g., Secretary; receptionist*
        - Women supervise fewer subordinates than men and are less likely to control financial resources. *E.g., Women in Human Resources; Men in Finance Departments*
        - Women's authority is sometimes undermined by co-workers. *E.g., "Iron Lady" movie clip*

## Gender Segregation: Explanations

1. Employer's Actions - Structural Barriers (*Padavic and Reskin: "Segregation," "Social Networks," and "Organizations' Personnel Practices"*)

    - Actions of employers most important: 
        - Often **concentrate** men and women into different jobs.
        - Or they **assign different tasks** to men and to women, within the same job. 
    
    - WHY? *E.g., HBS Case Study on hiring female MBAs*
        - Power: 
            - In-group favoritism: 
                - Most people within hiring power are men
                - They want to maintain men in power positions
                - Or simply like to work with similar others. *"Old Boys Club*
            - "Homosocial reproduction": 
                - To eliminate uncertainty hire someone like you
                - Employer believe that similar people are likely to make same decisions they would 
        - Cultural beliefs / Social expectations:
            - Employers' actions often based on **gender stereotypes**
            - Notions of what is "proper" work or tasks for men and women. *E.g., will assign men and women tasks that fit these expectations*
            - ***Abilities***: believe that men and women have different abilities or characteristics. Thus, they should do different jobs.
            - ***Needs***: believe that men and women have different needs. Men need to provide for family. 

2. ***Example***: Tolich and Briar, "*Just Checking It Out: Exploring the Significance of Informal Gender Divisions Among American Supermarket Employees*"

    - Background: 
        - Interviews with 65 supermarket employees in Northern California (22 were women).
        - Observations of workers in the check stands and in staff canteen 
        - 55 were "Journeymen Clerks"
        - All had same pay and job description - *What is the organizational structure?*
    
    - Results:
        - Task Segregation by Gender: 
            - **Were men and women segregated by task?**
            - How did this occur (formally? informally?)
        - Consequences of Task Segregation
            - Promotion: **How were promotion opportunities affected by gender segregation?**
            - Quality of working life: How did this segregation affect the work life of both men and women? 
        - Explanations for Segregation in Grocery Store: 
            - WHY did the segregation occur?
            - Which of the explanations (of employers' actions) mentioned above were operating here? 
    
    - Conclusions: 
        - Woman at one of these stores brought case of sex discrimination through her union.
        - 1992, S.F. judge ruled against Lucky Stores:
            - Lucky discriminated against women by systematically denying them promotions, training, and desirable work assignments. 

3. Explanations: Worker's own actions / preferences: Men and women often choose work/occupations that fit gender expectations.

    - Socialization to "gendered" work: 
        - Certain skills/work associated with each gender
        - Men and women are steered toward these gender-appropriate occupations.
        - People choose work that they have been socialized to think is appropriate for them
        - *E.g., Women prefer "feminine" work*
            - Because of socialization into feminine traits - caring, compassion, relationships
            - Women prefer work that centers around these traits
            - *E.g., nursing, teaching, social work*
    
    - Cultural Family/Work Options: 
        - 19-th Century Cultural notion of "Separate Spheres"
            - Men in the workforce
            - Women at home
        - These cultural ideas persist:
            - Men expected to provide financially for family
            - Women expected to provide emotionally, practically for family. 
        - However, women's options have expanded: 
            - Normative for women to go into labor force
            - Also normative for women to prioritize family
            - This can lead some women to "opt out" of more demanding jobs/occupations
        - Men have fewer options: 
            - Normative to go into labor force
            - NOT normative to stay home with family
            - More pressure to succeed at work 

4. ***Example***: Workers Own Actions, Christine Williams, "*Masculinity in Nursing*"

    - Here we see the exception to "gender-expected" occupations: men in a feminine occupation. 

    - How does this affect the men at work> 
        - The difficulties here, illustrate reasons that men and women may NOT choose gender-atypical work. 
    
    - Token Status at Work: 
        - > ***Tokenism***: when one category of people (*e.g., female*) is 15% or less of the work group; compared to 85% or more of the dominant category (*e.g., male*)
        - Male nurses are "tokens" in female world of nursing
            - Very small numbers of men in nursing - 5%
            - Major reason for low numbers:
                - Men do not want to be nurses because of the femininity of the occupation
            - Personality tests show that male nurses are no different than other men.
            - Many from working class.
                - No other options.

    - Gender interactions at work: Same gender informal work groups: 
        - Workers create shared values and ideas at work: 
            - These constitute a workplace culture,
        - Often this workplace culture revolves around separate-gender groups.
            - Largely because of sex segregation in jobs. 
        - > ***Gender displays***: language or rituals that are characteristic of one sex. 
        - Female work groups: gender displays: 
            - Focus talk on personal, familial events
            - Tendency to celebrate private life at work
            - These displays affirm heterosexuality and femininity.
        - Male work groups: gender displays: 
            - Sexual language and conversations about sex
            - "Macho: talk and behavior, sports talk
            - These gender displays affirm heterosexuality and masculinity.
        - **Tokenism exaggerates gender interactions at work.**
