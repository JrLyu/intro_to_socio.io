# What Is Sociology?

## 1. How Do We Define Sociology as Discipline?

1. Gladwell's "Food Fight":

   - Main points and arguments:

     1. Budget allocation -> tradeoffs

     2. Food at Bowdoin College is a moral problem

     3. Financial aid vs. other aspects of spending

     4. Vassar -> What's more important?

   - Things You Didn't know before: Universities do not need to pay taxes.

     ***Why?***

     1. Universities are non-profit organizations. Some universities buy lots of expensive properties to increase their endorsement, such as NYU. 
	  2. Universities are providing a public good, so they ought to receive some bonus from society. However, they also need to pay back society with high-quality and fair education. **Privilege leads to responsibilities.**
     
	- This podcast is NOT sociology. Instead, it provides some sociological perspectives. This podcast is not objection: 
	
	  1. It adds a moral opinion.
		2. It lacks sufficient evidence: 
	  
		   a) it only interviewed one student, and 
	  
		   b) it only picks "food" as the topic.
	
2. Sociology as a discipline:
	- Definition of Sociology:
		
     > Sociology is the systematic study and explanations of : 
     >
     > 1. Social behavior, 
     > 2. Social groups, and
     > 3. society.    	
   
   - Sociology is also interested in following contexts: 
   
     > Sociology Definition - ***Extended***: 
     >
     > Sociology is also interested in how **social forces** influence or shape our **individual behavior**. 

3. Sociology and other disciplines: Nature vs. Nurture debate
   - In Biology, we use Biology/genes to explain human behavior. 
   - In Psychology, we use mental process to explain human behavior. It focuses on explanations WHIHIN individuals. 
   - In Sociology, we use social interactions and environment to explain human behavior. It focuses on explanations in the EXTERNAL social realm. 



## Connecting Society and the Individual: Fundamental Theorem of Sociology
1. Social context shapes human behavior. *Social context = Environment*

2. Individual behavior is deeply shaped (*but not determined*) by social forces (social systems).

3. Thinking "sociologically":

   - See beyond merely the individual.

   - See behind assumptions of everyday life.

   - Begin to think about the way society is structured. 

     ***Example***: a Question for Thinking Sociologcially

     - "How are relationships organized?
     - "How are relationships between professors and students organized? "

4. A summary of Sociology as a Discipline: 
   ***Summary***: Sociology as a discipline: 
   - Sociology recognizes the importance of individuals and the importance of biological and psychological factors.
   - But, this is NOT ALL that is needed to explain human behavior.
   - Social Context (Environment) is an inescapable factor in human life.
   - Biology and Environment are inseparable.



## Sociology is a Social Science

1. Social science or "common sense?"

   - Common sense:

     > Common Sense: Common science is sound  judgment not based on specialized knowledge. 

   - Science: 

     > Science: Science is a ***system of knowledge*** covering the operation of general laws, obtained and tested through scientific method.

2. Scientific method: 

   - Scientific Method: 

     Scientific method refers to ***systematic*** pursuit of knowledge involving the recognition and formulation of a problem, the collection of ***data*** through observation and experiment, and the formulation and testing of hypotheses

   - Why do we need scientific methods? 
     We what to make sure that our study and research is replicable. 

3. Sociology: 

   - Sociology - ***Refined Definition***: 

     > Sociology is the **systematic study**, using the scientific method, to test hypotheses/questions about social institutions, social interactions, and social relationships. 

   - Note on the Definition of Sociology: 

     As indicated by the definition, sociology only focus on people as a group; sociology never studies individuals and individual behaviors. 	

4. Anecdote V.S. Empirical Evidence: 

   - Anecdote: 

     > Anecdote is a usually short narrative of an interesting, amusing, or biographical incident. 

   - Evidence:

     > Evidence is something that furnishes proof. 

   - Empirical: 

     > The word "empirical" means "based on observation; capable of being verified or disproved by observation or experiment. "

5. Social science and generalizations: 

   - Category: 

     > Category means to distinguish one thing from another; how we make distinctions between things. 

   - Generalization: 

     > Generalization means the characteristic of objects within a category; defines similarities and differences with other categories. 

   - Stereotype: 

     > Stereotype is an exaggerated description applied to every person in some category. 

   - The purpose of social science is to develop accurate categorizations and generalizations about humans. 

   - Sociology can predict: 

     1. Which ***groups*** will be *more likely* to engage in certain types of behavior. 
     2. But, not which ***particular person*** in the group will conduct certain types of behavior. - ***Sociology only studies humans as a group not human as an individual.***
     3. Sociology predicts categories (and generalizations about them), but not a precise individual's behavior.
