<p>We look at how social factors shape two aspects of romantic love in the US: Love and Marriage \&amp; Sex without Love</p>
<h2 id="who-do-you-love">Who do you love?</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Isn&apos;t it very individual and personal? </p>
<ul>
<li>All societies have <strong><em>distinct social patterns</em></strong> associated with love.</li>
<li>Our practices and beliefs about love are <strong><em>socially constructed</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The Social Construction of Love: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Eva Illouz&apos;s <em>Consuming the Romantic Utopia</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Helps illustrate the <strong>social construction</strong> of courtship/dating.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The changing space of courtship.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Moved from the private sphere to the public sphere</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dating involves negotiating public spaces; knowing how to conduct oneself: Manners, culturally constrained behaviors</p>
<p><em>e.g.: Country club, proper attire, adhering to the social norms of a particular group or subculture.</em> </p>
</li>
<li><p>The economization of social relationships: now \textbf{consumption} played a huge role in dating: How much money do we spend? Where do we spend it? </p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Viviana Zelizer&apos;s <em>The Purchase of Intimacy</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Love is also a system that has its equivalence in goods, services, and entitlements. </p>
<p><strong><em>Example</em></strong>: How do you know when you are on a date? </p>
<pre><code>-  What was the meaning of the consumption we now saw in dating? 
-  What constitutes a gift and what constitutes payment? How do you know? 
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>We have cultural templates that allow us to understand: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>the intimacy level between two people</p>
</li>
<li><p>the behavioral boundaries of a relationship</p>
</li>
<li><p>the economic boundaries of a relationship between two people </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>These boundaries are regulated by institutions, emotions, time, and the law. </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Social Factors and Mate Selection: Choice of mate is linked to social structure</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Patterns of mate selection: </p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Endogamy</em></strong>: Endogamy refers to marriage within a social group    </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Exogamy</em></strong>: Exogamy refers to marriage outside a social group    </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Social Stratification</em></strong>: A group&apos;s system of ranking.
<em>Note: Society&apos;s ranking of different statuses (large groups of people) according to a hierarchy, often based on prestige/values.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The US patterns: </p>
<ul>
<li>Social class: Most people marry within their own social class.</li>
<li>Education: People marry others with similar education.</li>
<li>Age: Usually, 2-3 years difference. Societies also define the right age to get married. </li>
<li>Religion: Most marry within the same religious group, but less endogamous than other categories. </li>
<li>Race: This is one of the most endogamous categories, but the proportion varies by race. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Explanations for endogamous patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preferences play a role: <ul>
<li>Individuals have preference for certain characteristics in a spouse.</li>
<li>Our preferences are shaped by our social groups and statuses</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Indirect regulation of mate selection</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Formally Free&quot; mate selection, but <strong>indirect regulation</strong> through <strong>restriction of social interaction</strong>.<ul>
<li>Influence of third parties (parents)</li>
<li>Propinquity (proximity: e.g., residential segregation; school; workplace)</li>
<li>Sanctions (e.g., religious)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Those indirect regulations are ways to assure you &quot;marry the right person.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Regulation of mate selection ensures social control </p>
<ul>
<li>Without controls over mate selection - would have social chaos</li>
<li>Different interpretations of social control over love. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Example</em></strong>: William Goode&apos;s <em>The Theoretical Importance of Love</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Free love threatens class system</li>
<li>Marriage between different class groups would disrupt social status of group</li>
<li>Mate selection is most important for those with power and property. So, they place more restrictions on children and their social interactions.</li>
<li>These mate selections patters serve to reinforce ad reproduce your <strong>position in social structure</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-is-love-definitions-and-meaning-of-love">What is Love? Definitions and meaning of Love</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Love and Marriage: </p>
<p><strong><em>Example</em></strong>: Swidler: Talk of Love <em>(The link between love and marriage and how we use culture to socially construct those concepts)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Background of book (Introduction): </p>
<ul>
<li>Interviewed 88 middle-class men and women from suburban areas San Jose, CA.</li>
<li>Not typical, but &quot;Proto-typical&quot; Americans</li>
<li>&quot;Middle-class&quot; culture tends to be the dominant culture in our country - or &quot;mainstream&quot; culture</li>
<li>Most of the participants were in their 30&apos;s and 40&apos;s and were or had been married. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Culture nations of love: what is the cultural meaning of &quot;romantic love&quot; in the US? Two different views of love emerge in respondents&apos; interviews. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Love Myths - Mythic Love</em></strong><ul>
<li>Historical origins: Courtly Love Tradition</li>
<li>Bourgeois tradition reshapes courtly love<ol>
<li>A decisive choice (love at first sight)</li>
<li>A unique other (one true love)</li>
<li>Overcoming obstacles (marrying for love, not money)</li>
<li>Love lasts forever (&quot;happily ever after&quot;)    </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Real Love - Prosaic Realism</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Participants often de-bunk the notion of mythic love.</li>
<li>Offer an alternative cultural view of &quot;real love&quot;: <ul>
<li>Love grows slowly; is often ambivalent and confused</li>
<li>One can love many people in a variety of ways</li>
<li>Love should be based on compatibility and practical traits that make good partners.</li>
<li>Love does not necessarily last forever. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Love involves emotional sharing, communication, often equality, respect.</li>
<li>Working at the relationship day-to-day</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>People talk about both these views of love when talking about what love means to them</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Sex without Love: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>US in the 19th and 20th century: </p>
<p>Sex = Love (form Judeo-Christian culture)</p>
<ul>
<li>Norm: Sex is part of committed loving relationship</li>
<li>Values: Sex is sacred part of love relationship between monogamous couple</li>
<li>So, sex without love is deviant</li>
<li>In 1950&apos;s, Kinsey survey showed that more people engaged in casual sex than was expected.</li>
<li>More recent patterns of sexual behavior\</li>
<li>Still, the US norm is against sex without loving commitment. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>21st century</p>
<p><strong><em>Case Study</em></strong>: Lambert et. al. <em>Pluralistic Ignorance and Hooking Up</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Background: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the post, research has assumed that sex without love is a problem (goes against norms). </p>
</li>
<li><p>Today, on college campuses, this kind of behavior (&quot;hooking up&quot;) has become normative.</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>Hooking up</strong> occurs when two people who are casual acquaintances engage in some forms of sexual behavior with the expectation of no future commitment.     </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Background studies on &quot;hooking up&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevalence: What is the prevalence of hooking up? </li>
<li>Bad experiences: What &quot;bad experiences&quot; do students describe? Gender differences in bad experiences?     </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Theory: Pluralistic Ignorance: </p>
<ul>
<li>Perceptions of other&apos;s attitudes: Group members believe that <strong>others</strong> in their group (especially leaders or popular people) <strong>endorse a particular norm</strong>. </li>
<li>Own attitudes: yet, they believe their <strong>own personal attitudes</strong> are different from the norm.</li>
<li>Actual behavior: however, they go along with the norm because: <ul>
<li>Desire to fit in with the group.</li>
<li>Each person thinks that they are <strong>the only one who has conflict</strong> between their <strong>personal attitudes</strong> and their <strong>actual behavior</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Methods: </p>
<ul>
<li>Survey</li>
<li>Sample of 175 female and 152 male undergrads at mid-sized southeastern public university.</li>
<li>Convenience sample (library; residence halls)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Results: </p>
<ul>
<li>77.7% of women said they had hooked up</li>
<li>84.2% of men said they had hooked up</li>
<li>The results with regard to comfort level with hooking up? </li>
<li>Same-sex peers: How did men and women rate their comfort levels (self-ratings) as compared to others of same sex (peer-ratings)?</li>
<li>Opposite-sex peers: How did men and women rate the comfort levels of the opposite sex? Did they over- or under-estimate comfort levels? </li>
<li>Gender differences: What were the overall gender differences? </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Conclusions: </p>
