# Social Class

## Social Class

1. > ***Social Stratification***: A system by which a society ranks categories of people in a hierarchy.

    - System of inequality

    - Major system of stratification in industrialized societies: *social class system*

2. > ***Social Class**: social structural position a group holds relative to the **economic, social, political, and cultural resources** of society.

    - Class is about **more than income**.

    - Class determines **access to resources**.

    - Class puts people in different positions of advantage or disadvantage. *e.g., Ehrenreich reading*

3. What is social class? *e.g., Film: Inequality for All*

## Models of Society

1. Marx (Conflict Theory) - Karl Marx (1818 - 1883)

    - Economic Structure and Class Position: 
        - Social structure of all societies is determined by **economic structure**.
            - Think: how much wealth people have relative to others.
        - Western Europe & U.S.: economic structure is Capitalism
    
    - > ***Social Class*** is all about position in the **economic structure**

    - **Social class = relationship to "*Means of Production*"**

    - > ***Means of Production*** = system by which goods are produced and distributed.

    - Under *Capitalism*: 
        - Two basic relationships to the Means of Production: 
            - **Own/Control** means of production (Capitalist class or Bourgeoisie)
            - **Label for others** (Working class or Proletariat)
            - *E.g., Pillow factory*
        - This produces a **2-level hierarchical *social class* system**.
            - Capitalist class has power -- Powerful (Bourgeoisie)
            - Working class has little or no power -- Poor (Proletariat)
        - This system leads to conflict and revolution. 
    
    - Class and Power: 
        - **Economic Structure** is PRIMARY: 
            - Other parts of social structure reflect capitalist interests.
            - *E.g., Politics, Education, Law*
            - > ***Base***: material forces of production and their economic foundations.
            - > ***Superstructure***: legal, political, religious, philosophic, aesthetic life.
        - Thus, **Capitalist class** has **power** and controls resources (in all other spheres of social structure): 
            - *E.g., Political resources*
            - *E.g., Religious institutions*
            - *E.g., Educational institutions*
        - **They control most resources and perpetuate the system that benefits them**
            - **E.g., Debt from college**
        - The elite also reproduce the class structure in each new generation.
            - Through the **family wealth** and power are passed down from generation to generation.
            - The **legal system** defends private property and inheritance.
            - Elite children **mix** at elite schools and other institutions.
                - Forging social ties that will benefit them throughout their lives. 
    
    - Critique of Marx: 
        - Two-level economic system is too simplistic.
        - Is economic position ALL-important?
        - Are the only ones who are powerful those with economic resources? 
        - What do you observe in "*Inequality for All*"? 
        - [Clip from Roseanne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrectdcH81U)

2. Weber (Structural Conflict) - Max Weber (1864 - 1920) Germany

    - Social stratification involves 3 dimensions of inequality: 
        - ***Class***: **economic** position (continuum): 
            - One can have a higher or lower economic position.
            - Related to ability to control **economic resources**
        - ***Status***: degree of **prestige** or social honor
            - One can have a higher or lower position of prestige in society.
            - Occupation and/or education are usually the basis for amount of prestige. *E.g., BA, MA, MBA, PhD*
            - Related to ability to control **cultural resources**.
        - ***Power***: ability to make other people do what you want (**political** power)
            - One can have higher or lower position in the political realm.
            - Related to ability to control **political/government resources**. 
        - These 3 dimensions often go together, but not always. *Examples of when they may not be consistent?*
    
    - These three dimensions of inequality lead to three different groups in society. Class, Status, and Power are the basis for three different types of *groups* in society: 
        - **Class = economic group**; those with similar market position.
            - Think: "Upper-Middle Class," "Middle Class," etc.
            - Group based on economic aspect of occupation (income), as well as overall wealth.
            - Similar in terms of economic resources/power. 
        - **Status = "Status group"**: a community which has a similar "style of life."
            - Group based on prestige of occupation (often linked to educational attainment as well).
            - Similar in terms of cultural style/resources.
        - **Power = Party**: organized group pursuing power.
            - Group based on political position.
            - Similar in terms of political resources/view. 
    
    - Critique of Weber: 
        - Weber discounted income too much: <br> Although class lines not always clear, income is a primary dividing factor in high-income societies. (*a PhD won't buy you a Mercedes!*)
        - Income inequality has increased in recent years in the U.S. (bigger divide)
        - Some think that Marx's view of rich and power is closer to reality than Weber's multidimensional hierarchy. 
    
    - Weber's great contribution: 
        - Social inequality/class is a **multidimensional ranking** rather than a hierarchy of clearly defined economic (income) groups.
        - In line with this thinking, sociologists use the term -> **Socio-economic Status (SES)**: a **composite** ranking based on various dimensions of social inequality. *E.g., income, wealth, occupation, education*

3. Comparison of Marx and Weber: 

| Marx | Weber | Example |
| :--: | :---: | :-----: |
| **Status and power are simply reflections of class** (economic position) | Class, status, and power often go together, but **not always**. | Local government official - high power, only moderate status and class |
| Social conflict is between 2 economic classes | Social conflict is variable and complex and occurs differently across the three dimensions. | Government officials vs. small business owners; middle managers vs. factory workers |
| Class structure is reproduced generation to generation by **ownership of the means of production**. | Class is reproduced by elite status groups through **social networks and cultural capital** | |

## Social Class in the U.S.
Measuring Social Class: Socio-Economic Status (SES): multidimensional

1. **Income**: wages from work and earnings from investments

2. **Wealth**: total value of assets and less debts (This is most close to Marx)

3. **Occupational Prestige** (similar to Weber's "Status"): 
    - How important people consider each occupation
    - High prestige occupations most often required extensive training and have high income.
    - Low prestige often to those jobs that pay less and require less ability and schooling. 

4. **Education**

5. **Power** is harder to quantify - usually seen as part of income or occupation. 

## Consequences of Social Class

***Example***: Ehrenreich Article - "*Working Poor*"
- What were some of the consequences of living on the minimum wage?
- Is the minimum wage of "living wage"? 
- > ***Living wage***: wage necessary for a person working 40 hours a week to afford a certain minimum standard of living (*e.g., be able to pay for food, housing, utilities, transportation, healthcare*)
- [Colbert Report Clip](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/8fg72p/the-colbert-report-minimum-wage---mcdonald-s-spending-journal)

1. Physical health:
    - Higher mortality for children born into poor families.
    - Lower life spans for adults in lower classes

2. Relationships: 
    - Divorce is more common among poor
    - Single parent families more common

3. Residential, social life: 
    - Income affects where you live
    - Social services are frequently less for the poor. 

## Cultural Dimension of Social Class: Cultural Capital & Consequences

1. Cultural Capital Theory: 

- Later theorists have used Weber's notions of status group to show how **cultural resources** are an important part of the social class system in many societies. *Think: education*

    - From Weber:
        - Social stratification has three dimensions. 
        - Class, status, and power are the basis for three different types of *groups* in society
    
    - Status and status groups: 
        - Poeple with the same status have similar lifestyles, and, thus, form "status groups."
            - Having similar cultural experiences - **shared**
            - *E.g., "Foodies"; Artsy Movie theaters (Midtown Arts Cinema)*
        - These groups are parts of the social class system. 
    
    - Status Groups and Establishing Cultural Capital: 
        - High status groups establish their **own cultural traits** as the *most valued culture* (cultural capital): 
            - This can include knowing WHEN to speak and HOW to interpret things
                - *E.g., Clapping between movements at symphony*
                - *E.g., How to behave at a museum/gallery*
                - *E.g., Knowing WHEN to speak and HOW to speak, negotiating rules, etc.*
    
    - They maintain their high status by **knowing** and **using** these cultural traits.

    - **Systems in society give advantages to people with "higher" cultural traits or knowledge**

- ***Example***: [Accents or ways of speaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ketrhWr58wA): Do accents have certain associations/meanings? Which ones sound "smarter"? 

    - Cultural Capital: 
        - > ***Cultural Capital***: Distinctive **cultural traits, attitudes, and styles** which can be used as resources/capital to **gain advantages in society**. 
            - "Knowledge and familiarity with **styles** and **genres** that are **socially valued** and that ***confer prestige* upon those who have mastered them**." –Bourdieu & Passeron
        - ***Example***: 
            - "Refined" taste/style of clothing, home decor, other material possessions. *E.g., Abstract art*
            - "Proper" etiquette - table manners, speech patterns, language usage
            - Familiarity with "high culture" - art, music, theater
        - Elite (high) status groups pass this *cultural capital* from one generation to the next.
        - *E.g., Students with high cultural capital tend to: *
            - Communicate more easily (*e.g., Learning how to speak with adults in primary school*)
            - Receive more attention and assistance
            - Be thought of as more intelligent (accents? vacbulary?)

2. ***Example***: Cultural Capital and Consequences: Aries and Seider, "*Lower Income Students at Elite vs. State Schools*" <br> How do class-based aspects of identity shape the college experience? 

    - Methods: In-depth interviews with 30 white lower income college students
        - 15 at "Little Ivy"
        - 15 at "State College"
    
    - Results: 
        - Little Ivy vs. State College
            - Which kind of college presents the most challenge to lower income students? WHY? 
        - Little Ivy: 
            - What are some of the **consequences** of being a lower income student at an elite college? 
            - What kinds of "cultural capital" do lower income students feel they **lack**? 
            - What kinds of "new capital" do the students fell they **gain** in the elite college? 
    
    - Summary: 
        - Lower income students face greater challenges at elite schools than at state schools. 
            - WHY? 
        - Some challenges are about economic resources. 
            - Examples? 
        - A lot of the challenges have to do with cultural resources or cultural capital.
            - Examples? 
            - Consequences? 
        - Many of these students assimilate middle/upper class cultural capital during college. 

3. ***Example***: Annette Lareau, "*Invisible Inequality: Social Class and Child-rearing in Black Families and White Families*"

    - Background: 
        - Debate among sociologists about the transmission of class advantages to children.
        - Many think that **family life** has little effect (would say it's more about schools, etc.)
        - Most studies have not given enough attention to the **"culture" of the home**. i.e., **The meaning of events or *the way the family interacts***. 
    
    - Hypotheses: 
        - **Child-rearing approaches** (part of culture) **vary by class**
        - These different child-rearing approaches have **different effects on life outside the home**. They create **advantages (or not)** for children. 
    
    - Methods (Table 1): 
        - Qualitative study of black and white children, middle-class, working class, and poor
        - Interviews and observations of children aged 8-10.
        - Interviews with parents.
        - Total of 88 families
        - Home observations with 12 of these families. 
    
    - Results: 
        - Child-rearing Approaches - **cultural logic** (pp. 752-753; 761-765; Table 2)
            - These approaches arise from *values* and *beliefs* about child-rearing.
            - **Cultural child-rearing beliefs** are different for the two social classes.
            - **Middle class parents: "Concerted Cultivation"**
                - Organization of daily life: 
                    - Foster child's talents through leisure activities
                    - Believe these activities transmit important life skills.
                - Language use: 
                    - Development of reasons.
                    - Parents use extensive reasoning for discipline. 
                - Social connections:
                    - Weak extended family ties; play with children same age. 
                - *E.g., "Developing Alexander Williams" (pp. 753-757)*
            - **Working Class Parents: "Accomplishment of Natural Growth"**: 
                - Organization of daily life:
                    - Provide love, food, safety (conditions for children to grow)
                    - Do no focus on developing children's talents
                    - Few organized leisure activities - child "hangs out"
                - Language use: 
                    - Parents use "**directives**" rather than reasoning for discipline. 
                - Social connections: 
                    - Strong extended family ties; play with wide age of children. 
                - *E.g., "Supporting the Natural Growth of Harold McAllister" (pp. 757-759)*
            - [What type of parenting style is the adult exhibiting here? What about the children? ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeOsRggJO4s)
        - Effects of Child-rearing Approaches ("*Impact of Child-rearing Approaches on Interactions with Institutions,*" pp. 766-770; Table 2): 
            - **Middle Class Effect: Emerging "Sense of Entitlement" (Cultural Capital)**: 
                - **Middle class parents try to get institutions to respond to their individual needs.**
                - Informed, assertive in interactions.
                - Not intimidated or confused in interactions.
                - See these encounters as **among peers**
                - What emerges is a "**sense of entitlement**" for the child: urge adults to accommodate their individual preferences. 
                - *E.g., Alexander at doctor's office*: How does this sense of entitlement play out?
            - **Working Class Effect: Emerging "Sense of Constraint" (A "lesser" cultural capital)** 
                - Working class parents are cautious in interactions.
                    - WHY? 
                - Parents accept authority figures as such - don't question or assert selves.
                - Distrustful of professionals - feel bullied and powerless.
                - What emerges is a "sense of constraint" for the child: 
                    - Children are passive and compliant with adults
                    - Boundaries between adults and children are clearer. 
                    - *E.g., Harold at doctor's office*: How does this sense of constraint play out? 
        - CONSEQUENCES of these Class Effects:
            - **Middle Class Sense of Entitlement - Advantages** 
                - Gain advantages from this way of **relating to outside professionals**
                - Middle class children expect institutions to be responsive to them and accommodate their individual needs, and **this tends to happen**.
                    - *E.g., Doctor takes medical concerns seriously*
                    - *E.g., Parent gets child into gifted program*
            - **Working Class Sense of Constraint - Few advantages**: 
                - Sense of constraint leads outside institutions to treat them differently.
                - **Passivity is not rewarded**, but looked down on, especially at school. 
                    - *E.g., School officials are dismissive towards these parents.*
                - Then the parents, frustrated by unresponsive of school, tell kids to deal with things in way that **institution will further dislike**: 
                    - *E.g., "hit the boy that's bothering you*
        - Summary (*"Why does social class matter?" pp. 771-772*)
            - **RQ: Does social class determine these parenting styles**
            - Both **status group** (education and lifestyle/occupation) **and economic position** are connected to these **cultural styles of parenting**. 
            - The two parenting styles are influenced by:
                - **Economic resources** - ability to take children to organized activities
                - **Parents' education** (part of status group) - language use and vocabulary
                - **Life experiences**/Occupational conditions (part of status group/culture)
                    - Middle class: Working is rewarding, want to instill work values in children - games and activities do this. 
                    - Working class: Working is deadening; just follow orders; see some of this in child-rearing.
